# image-processing
Collection of image processing algorithms with as much written by me as possible.

Alogrithms contained:
- monochrome
- thresholding
- 2d convolution
- Gaussian blur
- kernel based edge detection (Sobel, Sobel-Feldman, Sharr operators)
- Hough line detection
- on image line drawing

To do:
- Update readme with images and examples
- Give ability to pick algorithm without changes in code
- Circle Hough transform
- drawing of detected lines and circles
- line options (antialiasing, color, point style)
- k means based color clustering with palette generation
